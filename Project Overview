# 🌐 Cloud-Based Digital Twin for Embedded Systems  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project simulates an **AI-driven embedded system** in the cloud, allowing users to **monitor, analyze, and control** IoT devices in real-time without physical components.  
It integrates:  
- **AI-based anomaly detection** for predictive maintenance  
- **Real-time MQTT communication** between sensors & cloud  
- **3D Digital Twin (Three.js)** for visual representation  
- **Cloud storage & analytics (Firebase)**
